I started contributing to Open Source projects in 2013 and over time I authored, contributed to and helped many libraries, frameworks. This page lists my most notable contributions and projects.

# Kemal

[Kemal](https://kemalcr.com/) is the most popular web framework for Crystal. It's motto is 'Fast, Effective, Simple'. I'm the author of Kemal and been maintaining it since 2015.

# Crystal

[Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) is a programming language with the following goals:

 - Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
 - Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
 - Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
 - Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
 - Compile to efficient native code.

I'm a Crystal Core Team member since 2018.
